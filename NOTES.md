Meeting Notes
==========
Date: Nov, 16 2012

* Consider reproducing just once per lifetime
* Shift reproduction to threshold function such that the energy required (h), is h=(max)geneticfecundity / some constant
* Differentiate between empty sites and other forms of migration
* Add patch extinction
* Factors to manipulate
	- Founding group size: 2, 10, complete fission
	- Immigration success: 0%, 2%, 5%, 100% with a fixed survival probability 
	- Patch extinction rate: 0%, 10%, 25%, 100%

* Also we will manipulate nuisance factors such as the number of patches or resource levels but we want to make sure we are invariant to these factors.
