TODO list of tasks for our simulation model.  Tasks in bold are already accomplished
----

* **Set up documentation in Sphinx**
* **Get basic energetics for single patch dynamics working**
* Code up rules for sexual reproduction within a patch
* Develop within patch data structures that keep track of lineages and individual fitness

Once these basic within patch tasks are accomplished we can move on to metapopulation dynamics

* Develop dispersal code
	* Create dispersal rules 
	* Implement dispersal rules 
* Develop patch group level metrics for fitness and data structures to keep track of them.

When the model is completed, we then need opitimization

* Profile code
* Add cython to speed up where necessary

Finally we'll need full parameterization and development of different conditions
